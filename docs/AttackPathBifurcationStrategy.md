# Attack Path Bifurcation Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase - Not Yet Implemented

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for implementing **attack path bifurcation analysis** - a feature that identifies alternative attack paths (branches) from intermediate stages of an existing cyber kill chain attack path.

**Key Concept:** After generating a primary attack path (stages 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7), analyze each stage to identify decision points where an attacker could pursue alternative techniques, then generate continuation paths from those bifurcation points.

## Core Concept

### What is Attack Path Bifurcation?

**Bifurcation** = A point in an attack path where multiple alternative continuation paths exist based on the attacker's gained access, capabilities, and available targets.

### Key Principles

1. **Start with primary path**: Generate one complete attack path through all cyber kill chain stages
2. **Context-aware analysis**: At each stage, consider what the attacker has gained (access, credentials, network position)
3. **Identify alternatives**: Find other techniques/targets available from that position
4. **Generate continuations**: Create full continuation paths from each bifurcation point
5. **Probabilistic ranking**: Include lower-probability branches for comprehensive coverage

### Not Multiple Entry Points

‚ùå **This is NOT:**
```
Path A: Start ‚Üí Docker ‚Üí Root
Path B: Start ‚Üí SQL Injection ‚Üí Root
Path C: Start ‚Üí SSH ‚Üí Root
```

‚úÖ **This IS:**
```
Primary: [1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5‚Üí6‚Üí7]

Bifurcation at Stage 3:
‚îú‚îÄ Branch A: [3‚Üí4a‚Üí5a‚Üí6a‚Üí7a]
‚îî‚îÄ Branch B: [3‚Üí4b‚Üí5b‚Üí6b‚Üí7b]

Bifurcation at Stage 5:
‚îî‚îÄ Branch C: [5‚Üí6c‚Üí7c]
```

---

## Current State vs Future State

### Current Implementation ‚úÖ

**What We Have:**
- Single linear attack path generation
- 50+ optional input parameters
- Dynamic prompt building
- LLM-based path generation
- Structured response with recommendations

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "attack_path": [
    {
      "stage": "Reconnaissance",
      "technique": "Port scanning",
      "description": "...",
      "mitre_attack_id": "T1046"
    },
    // ... 6 more stages
  ],
  "summary": "Attack path analysis",
  "recommendations": ["Fix Docker API", "..."]
}
```

### Future State üéØ

**What We'll Add:**
- Bifurcation detection at each stage
- Alternative path generation from decision points
- Branch probability scoring
- Attack graph visualization
- Comprehensive coverage of attack possibilities

**Example Enhanced Output:**
```json
{
  "primary_path": [/* 7 stages */],
  "bifurcations": [
    {
      "stage_index": 3,
      "stage_name": "Execution",
      "decision_point": "Attacker has Docker container access",
      "available_alternatives": 3,
      "branches": [
        {
          "branch_id": "B1",
          "probability": "medium",
          "continuation_path": [/* stages 4-7 */]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "total_paths": 5,
  "attack_graph": {/* graph structure */}
}
```

## Bifurcation Logic

### When Does a Bifurcation Occur?

A bifurcation exists at stage N when:

1. **Multiple targets available** from current position
   - Example: "From web server, can reach database OR Jenkins OR internal network"

2. **Multiple techniques possible** for next kill chain stage
   - Example: "For privilege escalation, can exploit kernel OR sudo misconfiguration OR weak passwords"

3. **Context enables alternatives** based on what attacker gained
   - Example: "After compromising Docker, attacker can see Jenkins credentials in environment variables"

4. **Lower-probability but viable paths** exist
   - Example: "Primary: container escape (80% success). Alternative: exploit Jenkins from container (40% success)"

### Bifurcation Criteria

**Must have ALL of:**
- ‚úÖ Attacker has gained access/capabilities at this stage
- ‚úÖ System has multiple exploitable elements visible from this position
- ‚úÖ Alternative techniques align with remaining kill chain stages
- ‚úÖ Alternative path is technically feasible (even if lower probability)

**Examples from `example_request_enhanced.json`:**

**Stage 3 Bifurcation (After Docker Access):**
- **Context**: Attacker has container access, can see internal network
- **Alternative 1**: Continue with container escape (original path)
- **Alternative 2**: Pivot to Jenkins (visible on network, unauthenticated)
- **Alternative 3**: Pivot to MySQL (accessible with default credentials)

**Stage 5 Bifurcation (After Initial Persistence):**
- **Context**: Attacker has low-privilege persistence
- **Alternative 1**: Escalate via kernel exploit (original path)
- **Alternative 2**: Escalate via sudo misconfiguration
- **Alternative 3**: Escalate via service account hijacking

## Technical Approach

### Three-Pass System

#### **Pass 1: Primary Path Generation**
*Uses existing implementation*

```
Input: Host parameters (50+ fields)
Process: Build dynamic prompt ‚Üí Call LLM ‚Üí Parse response
Output: Primary attack path (7 stages)
```

**Existing code handles this** - no changes needed.

---

#### **Pass 2: Bifurcation Detection**

```
Input: Primary attack path from Pass 1 + Host parameters
Process: For each stage, analyze context and identify alternatives
Output: List of bifurcation points with decision context
```

**LLM Prompt Strategy:**
```
System: You are an expert penetration tester analyzing attack paths.

User: Given this attack path and host data, identify decision points 
where the attacker has multiple viable alternatives:

PRIMARY PATH:
Stage 1: Reconnaissance - Port scanning
Stage 2: Initial Access - Exploit Docker API
Stage 3: Execution - Deploy malicious container
Stage 4: Privilege Escalation - Container escape
...

HOST CONTEXT:
- Docker API exposed (port 2375)
- Jenkins unauthenticated (port 8080)
- MySQL with default credentials (port 3306)
...

For each stage, identify:
1. What access/capabilities has the attacker gained?
2. What other targets/techniques are now available?
3. What are viable alternative paths from this point?

Return JSON with bifurcation points.
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "bifurcations": [
    {
      "stage_index": 3,
      "stage_name": "Execution",
      "attacker_context": "Has Docker container access, can see internal network",
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "id": "B1",
          "reason": "Jenkins visible and unauthenticated",
          "technique": "Pivot to Jenkins exploitation",
          "probability": "medium"
        },
        {
          "id": "B2",
          "reason": "MySQL accessible with default creds",
          "technique": "Pivot to database compromise",
          "probability": "medium"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

#### **Pass 3: Alternative Path Generation**

```
Input: Each bifurcation point from Pass 2 + Host parameters
Process: For each alternative, generate continuation through remaining kill chain
Output: Complete branch paths from bifurcation points
```

**LLM Prompt Strategy (per bifurcation):**
```
System: You are an expert penetration tester creating attack paths.

User: Generate a continuation attack path from this bifurcation point:

BIFURCATION POINT:
Stage: 3 (Execution)
Attacker Context: Has Docker container access
Alternative Technique: Pivot to Jenkins exploitation

HOST CONTEXT:
- Jenkins 2.346.1 without authentication on /script endpoint
- Docker container has network access to Jenkins
...

Generate the remaining kill chain stages (4-7) following this alternative:
- Stage 4: Privilege Escalation (on Jenkins)
- Stage 5: Persistence
- Stage 6: Lateral Movement
- Stage 7: Exfiltration

Return JSON with complete continuation path.
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "branch_id": "B1",
  "from_stage": 3,
  "continuation_path": [
    {
      "stage": "Privilege Escalation",
      "technique": "Jenkins Groovy Script Console RCE",
      "description": "Execute arbitrary code via unauthenticated /script endpoint",
      "mitre_attack_id": "T1059.007"
    },
    // ... stages 5-7
  ]
}
```

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

For each stage in the primary path, determine:

1. **Attacker Context**: What access, credentials, or capabilities has the attacker gained by this stage?

2. **Available Alternatives**: Based on the attacker's context and system configuration, what other 
   targets or techniques are now accessible?

3. **Bifurcation Viability**: Are there multiple viable paths forward? Consider:
   - Other exploitable services visible from attacker's position
   - Alternative techniques for the next kill chain stage
   - Pivot opportunities to other systems
   - Lower-probability but feasible alternatives

4. **Continuation Feasibility**: Can the alternative lead to a complete attack path through 
   remaining kill chain stages?

## API Design

### Option 1: Query Parameter (Recommended)

**Extend existing endpoint with backward compatibility**

```python
@app.post("/attack-path", response_model=EnhancedAttackPathResponse)
async def generate_attack_path(
    host: InputHost,
    include_prompt: bool = Query(default=True, description="Include generated prompt in response"),
    include_bifurcations: bool = Query(default=False, description="Analyze and include alternative attack paths")
):
    """
    Generate attack path analysis with optional bifurcation detection.
    
    Query Parameters:
    - include_prompt: Return the LLM prompt (debugging/transparency)
    - include_bifurcations: Perform multi-pass analysis to find alternative paths
    
    With bifurcations=false (default):
      - Returns standard single-path analysis
      - Fast response (1 LLM call)
      - Backward compatible with existing clients
    
    With bifurcations=true:
      - Returns enhanced analysis with branches
      - Slower response (1 + 1 + N LLM calls)
      - Provides comprehensive attack coverage
    """
    
    if include_bifurcations:
        # Three-pass analysis
        result = await analyzer.analyze_with_bifurcations(host, include_prompt)
    else:
        # Standard single-path analysis (existing functionality)
        result = await analyzer.analyze(host, include_prompt)
    
    return result
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible (existing clients unaffected)
- ‚úÖ Single endpoint, easy to discover
- ‚úÖ Progressive enhancement
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns

---

### Option 2: Separate Endpoint

**Add new endpoint for advanced analysis**

```python
@app.post("/attack-path", response_model=AttackPathResponse)
async def generate_attack_path(host: InputHost, include_prompt: bool = True):
    """Standard single-path analysis (existing endpoint)"""
    return await analyzer.analyze(host, include_prompt)

@app.post("/attack-graph", response_model=EnhancedAttackPathResponse)
async def generate_attack_graph(host: InputHost, include_prompt: bool = True):
    """Advanced multi-path analysis with bifurcations"""
    return await analyzer.analyze_with_bifurcations(host, include_prompt)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Clear semantic difference
- ‚úÖ Can have different rate limits/pricing
- ‚úÖ Easier to version independently
- ‚ùå More endpoints to maintain

---

### Recommended Approach

**Use Option 1 (Query Parameter)** for simplicity and backward compatibility.

**Example API Calls:**

```bash
# Standard analysis (current behavior)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/attack-path?include_bifurcations=false" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @example_request_enhanced.json

# Enhanced analysis with bifurcations
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/attack-path?include_bifurcations=true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @example_request_enhanced.json
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal:** Add data models and basic structure

**Tasks:**
1. Create new Pydantic models in `app/models/analysis.py`:
   - `AlternativeBranch`
   - `Bifurcation`
   - `AttackGraph`
   - `EnhancedAttackPathResponse`

2. Add new prompt builders in `app/core/prompts.py`:
   - `build_bifurcation_analysis_prompt()`
   - `build_branch_continuation_prompt()`

3. Update `app/services/analyzer.py`:
   - Add `analyze_with_bifurcations()` method (stub)

4. Update `app/main.py`:
   - Add `include_bifurcations` query parameter
   - Wire up new analyzer method

**Deliverable:** API accepts `include_bifurcations` parameter (returns empty bifurcations array)

---

### Phase 2: Bifurcation Detection (Week 2)

**Goal:** Implement Pass 2 (identify bifurcation points)

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `build_bifurcation_analysis_prompt()` fully
2. Add LLM call for bifurcation detection in analyzer
3. Parse bifurcation JSON response
4. Return bifurcations in response (without continuation paths yet)

**Testing:**
- Test with `example_request_enhanced.json`
- Verify bifurcations are identified at stages 2-3 (Docker ‚Üí Jenkins/MySQL)
- Validate JSON parsing

**Deliverable:** API returns identified bifurcation points with alternative descriptions

---

### Phase 3: Branch Generation (Week 3)

**Goal:** Implement Pass 3 (generate continuation paths)

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `build_branch_continuation_prompt()` fully
2. For each bifurcation/alternative, call LLM to generate continuation
3. Parse continuation path responses
4. Attach continuation paths to bifurcation branches
5. Handle LLM errors gracefully (continue with partial results)

**Testing:**
- Test complete three-pass flow
- Verify continuation paths are realistic
- Validate MITRE ATT&CK mappings

**Deliverable:** Full bifurcation analysis with complete branch paths

---

### Phase 4: Graph Visualization (Week 4)

**Goal:** Add attack graph representation

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `AttackGraph` builder:
   - Count total paths
   - Generate ASCII tree representation
   - Build JSON graph structure (nodes/edges)

2. Add graph to response

3. Create helper functions for path traversal

4. Update documentation

**Testing:**
- Generate graphs for various scenarios
- Validate ASCII output renders correctly
- Test JSON structure for frontend consumption

**Deliverable:** Complete bifurcation feature with visualization

---

### Phase 5: Optimization & Polish (Week 5)

**Goal:** Performance and quality improvements

**Tasks:**
1. Add caching for repeated bifurcation analyses
2. Implement parallel LLM calls for branch generation
3. Add probability scoring refinement
4. Optimize prompt token usage
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Write unit tests
7. Update all documentation
8. Create example notebooks/scripts

**Deliverable:** Production-ready bifurcation analysis

---

## Cost and Performance Considerations

### LLM Call Analysis

**Standard Analysis (current):**
- 1 LLM call for primary path
- ~2-4K tokens input, ~1-2K tokens output
- Response time: 5-15 seconds
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.03 per request (GPT-4)

**Bifurcated Analysis (new):**
- 1 LLM call for primary path (same as above)
- 1 LLM call for bifurcation detection (~3-5K tokens input, ~1K output)
- N LLM calls for branch generation (N = number of alternatives)
  - Each branch: ~3-5K tokens input, ~1-2K tokens output

**Example with 3 bifurcations (5 total alternatives):**
- Total LLM calls: 1 + 1 + 5 = 7 calls
- Total tokens: ~40-60K tokens
- Response time: 30-90 seconds (sequential) or 15-30 seconds (parallel)
- Cost: ~$0.10-0.25 per request (GPT-4)

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Parallel Branch Generation**: Generate all branches simultaneously
2. **Caching**: Cache bifurcation detection for similar hosts
3. **Streaming**: Stream results as they're generated (primary ‚Üí bifurcations ‚Üí branches)
4. **Model Selection**: Use faster/cheaper models for bifurcation detection (GPT-3.5)
5. **Max Branches**: Limit number of branches per bifurcation (e.g., top 3)
6. **Smart Prompting**: Reuse context across branch generation calls

### Performance Targets

- **Standard Analysis**: < 15 seconds, < $0.05
- **Bifurcated Analysis**: < 45 seconds, < $0.20
- **Max Bifurcations**: 5 decision points
- **Max Branches per Bifurcation**: 3 alternatives

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Comprehensive Security Assessment

**Scenario:** Security team needs to understand ALL possible attack paths

**Workflow:**
1. Run bifurcated analysis on critical asset
2. Review primary path (most likely attack)
3. Review all branches (alternative scenarios)
4. Prioritize fixes that block multiple paths

**Value:** "Fixing Docker + Jenkins blocks 4 out of 5 attack paths"

---

### Use Case 2: Red Team Planning

**Scenario:** Red team needs multiple attack approaches for engagement

**Workflow:**
1. Run bifurcated analysis on target
2. Select different branches for different team members
3. Execute parallel attacks
4. Document which paths worked

**Value:** Realistic multi-vector attack simulation

---

### Use Case 3: Defense Prioritization

**Scenario:** Limited budget, need to prioritize security controls

**Workflow:**
1. Run bifurcated analysis on all critical assets
2. Identify common bifurcation points across assets
3. Prioritize fixes that appear in multiple attack graphs
4. Measure reduction in total attack paths

**Value:** Data-driven security investment decisions

---

### Use Case 4: Incident Response Planning

**Scenario:** Need to prepare incident response playbooks

**Workflow:**
1. Run bifurcated analysis on production systems
2. For each branch, identify detection points and IOCs
3. Create runbooks for each attack path variant
4. Pre-position monitoring at bifurcation points

**Value:** Comprehensive IR coverage for all attack scenarios

## Open Questions

1. **Max Bifurcations**: Should we limit number of bifurcations detected? (Recommendation: max 5)

2. **Max Branches**: Should we limit alternatives per bifurcation? (Recommendation: max 3)

3. **Probability Threshold**: Should we filter out low-probability branches? (Recommendation: include all, let user filter)

4. **Visualization Format**: ASCII sufficient or need Mermaid/DOT output? (Recommendation: start with ASCII + JSON)

5. **Streaming**: Should results stream as generated? (Recommendation: defer to Phase 5)

6. **Caching**: Cache bifurcation analysis by host fingerprint? (Recommendation: yes, in Phase 5)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this strategy document** - validate approach with stakeholders
2. **Decide on API design** - confirm Query Parameter approach
3. **Set up development branch** - `feature/bifurcation-analysis`
4. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** - data models and scaffolding
5. **Create tracking issues** - one per phase for project management
